    <p><strong>Passionate about cybersecurity and IT in general</strong>, I earned my DUT in Computer Science in 2022 and am on track to graduate from École 2600 in August 2025. <strong>Driven by creativity</strong>, I’m eager to join a motivated team where I can contribute to ambitious projects centered around software development and cybersecurity challenges, starting September/October 2025.</p>
    <p>After several years of training and experience in both software development and cybersecurity, focusing on web development felt like a natural next step in my versatile journey. With this dual expertise, I’m excited to actively contribute to projects at the crossroads of web development and security — though I remain open to opportunities specifically in cybersecurity as well. Aware there’s still much to learn as a web developer, I humbly share my skills and aspirations across this personal website.</p>
